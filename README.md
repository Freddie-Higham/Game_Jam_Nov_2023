# Game_Jam_Nov_2023

Code and assets from a recent game jam. The theme was "descent".

My idea was you'd play as an angel desceding to earth and there would be plenty of obstacles in your way such as clouds, birds, planes, lighting and wind.

Due to this being from a game jam, the code is very messy.
