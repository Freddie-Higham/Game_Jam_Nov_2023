# Angel's Descent

Code and assets from a recent game jam. The theme was "descent".

The game has been added to since the jam. 

My idea was you'd play as an angel desceding to earth and there would be plenty of obstacles in your way such as clouds, birds, planes, lighting and wind. The quicker you reach the bottom, the more you're rewarded.

Due to this being from a game jam, the code is very messy.
