# Angel's Descent

Code and assets from a university game jam in Nov 2023. The theme was "descent". The game has been worked on a little since the jam. 

The idea is that you play as an angel desceding to earth but there are plenty of obstacles in your way such as clouds, birds, planes, lighting and wind. The quicker you reach the bottom, the more you're rewarded. So it's all about being a fast as possible. 

Due to this being from a game jam, the code is very messy.
